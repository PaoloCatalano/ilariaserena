            session, we will start with a quick guided meditation in order to
            reach the theta state. From there, we will work on the issues that
            you want to resolve, asking Creator for guidance to find out the
            bottom program or belief that is holding you back. At this point,
            with your permission, I will than ask for it to be removed and
            substitute with the right one that will allow the desired changes to
            manifest in your reality.

            The healing and the changes that are brought through ThetaHealingÂ®
            happen instantaneously, but the times that it takes for you to
            become aware of it depends on how ready your are to bring them into
            your life. Sometime you will notice instant changes, sometime it
            will take you some days before to notice a change.

            ThetaHealing is a growing path where you learn to understand who you
            truly are and one of the most amazing things about it is that you
            will discover that your mind, body and soul have always positive
            reasons why they are holding on a block, a disease or a belief
            program. You will understand that all what you create in your life
            always serves you to a purpose.
